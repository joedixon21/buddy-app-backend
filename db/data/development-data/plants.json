Its unusual pyramid shape makes it a popular landscape species and a favoured indoor plant. Not only is the Norfolk Island pine an attractive-looking tree, it is also a very versatile species. It is one of few plants that thrive in salty air, so it is a great choice for coastal gardens, as well as indoor spaces. The tree grows very slowly, but it is drought-tolerant and relatively pest-free, which makes it a great choice for Low-Maintenance gardeners. The overall beauty and adaptability of the Norfolk Island pine make it an amazing addition to any landscape."
